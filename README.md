## Overview

**Beats** is a frameless, always-on-top desktop widget for Windows. It keeps your music one glance away while you work, game, or browse - without cluttering the taskbar.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Local playback** | Folder-based playlists under `My Music\Beats` - portable, editable, and yours |
| **Web downloads** | Paste a URL; Beats saves MP3s into the playlist you choose |
| **Minimal UI** | A draggable pill with album art, transport controls, and an expandable dashboard |
| **Stay out of the way** | Hide off-screen with `Alt` + `\` or the top-screen chevron; bring it back instantly |

Built with **WPF** and **.NET 8**, powered by **LibVLC** for playback and **yt-dlp** / **spotDL** / **ffmpeg** for downloads (bootstrapped automatically on first use).

---

## What's new

**Latest: v2.2.18** — [Full changelog](CHANGELOG.md) | [Release notes](https://github.com/Delexoo/beats/releases/latest)

- **Playlist accordion** — expand playlists inline; click anywhere on the row header to open or close
- **Track artwork** — album covers in playlist song lists with smart caching
- **Click-outside to close** — the dashboard auto-minimizes when you click the player or another app
- **Headset controls** — play, pause, and skip from media keys (AirPods, keyboard, etc.)
- **In-app updates** — check and install new versions from the dashboard toolbar
- **Performance** — faster refreshes, smoother scrolling, and more responsive UI

## Quick start

<details open>
<summary><strong>Get running in under a minute</strong></summary>

<br />

1. **Download** the latest installer: [Beats-Setup-x64.exe](https://github.com/Delexoo/beats/releases/latest/download/Beats-Setup-x64.exe)
2. **Run** the installer and launch Beats from the Start menu.
3. **Open the dashboard** - click the settings gear on the pill, or press `Ctrl` + `\`.
4. **Create a playlist** - use **New Playlist** in the dashboard sidebar.
5. **Add music** - drag files into a playlist folder, or paste a URL to download.

On first download, Beats silently fetches `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`, and (for Spotify) `spotDL` into `%APPDATA%\Beats\tools`. This is a one-time setup (~130 MB total).

</details>

## Supported sources

<details>
<summary><strong>Platforms with first-class support</strong></summary>

<br />

| Platform | Method | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **YouTube** | yt-dlp | Videos, playlists, channels; optional cookies for restricted content |
| **Spotify** | spotDL | Tracks, albums, playlists with metadata |
| **Instagram** | yt-dlp | Reels, posts, IGTV, and share links; embed + mobile client fallbacks; audio pages search YouTube; optional cookies for login-only links |
| **TikTok** | yt-dlp | Short links auto-resolved; mobile/app API fallbacks |
| **SoundCloud** | yt-dlp | Tracks and sets |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Everything else yt-dlp supports</strong></summary>

<br />

Beats delegates generic URLs to [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), which supports **1,000+ sites**. If yt-dlp can extract audio from a link, Beats can download it as MP3.

Spotify links always route through spotDL regardless of URL pattern.

</details>

---

## System requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **OS** | Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit) |
| **Runtime** | [.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) (included in the installer) |
| **Disk space** | ~50 MB app + ~130 MB tools on first download |
| **Network** | Required for initial tool bootstrap and web downloads |

---

## Installation

<details open>
<summary><strong>End users - installer (recommended)</strong></summary>

<br />

Download the latest release:

**[Beats-Setup-x64.exe](https://github.com/Delexoo/beats/releases/latest/download/Beats-Setup-x64.exe)**

The installer registers Beats in the Start menu and handles the .NET 8 Desktop Runtime dependency.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>First-run tool bootstrap</strong></summary>

<br />

On the first web download, Beats automatically downloads these tools into `%APPDATA%\Beats\tools`:

| Tool | Size (approx.) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `yt-dlp.exe` | ~10 MB | Extract audio from web URLs (nightly build) |
| `ffmpeg.exe` | ~80 MB | Transcode and mux audio |
| `spotdl.exe` | ~42 MB | Spotify track/album/playlist downloads |

After the initial bootstrap, all downloads run locally with no additional setup.

## Development

<details>
<summary><strong>Build &amp; run from source</strong></summary>

<br />

**Prerequisites:** [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Delexoo/beats.git
cd beats
dotnet restore
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet run --project MusicWidget -c Release
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Build the Windows installer</strong></summary>

<br />

**Prerequisites:** [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) | [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Installer\Build-Installer.ps1
```

Output: `Installer\Output\Beats-Setup-x64.exe`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Publish a release</strong></summary>

<br />

Releases are built automatically by GitHub Actions when you push a version tag:

```powershell
git tag v2.2.0
git push origin v2.2.0
```

Or trigger manually: **Actions -> Release -> Run workflow**.

Each release uploads `Beats-Setup-x64.exe` under a stable filename so the website and README download links always resolve to the latest build.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Deploy the website (GitHub Pages)</strong></summary>

<br />

The landing page in `/website` deploys automatically on push to `main`.

Manual setup (one-time): **Settings -> Pages -> Source:** Deploy from branch `main`, folder `/website`.

Live URL: **[delexoo.github.io/beats](https://delexoo.github.io/beats/)**

</details>

---

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>YouTube downloads fail or say &quot;Sign in&quot;</strong></summary>

<br />

YouTube occasionally blocks automated downloads. In the dashboard help section, follow the **YouTube cookies** guide to export a Netscape-format `cookies.txt` from your browser and point Beats to it in settings.

Beats also retries with multiple yt-dlp player clients automatically before giving up.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Hotkeys don&apos;t work</strong></summary>

<br />

Another application may have registered the same key combo. Use the top chevron tab or on-screen buttons instead. Only one Beats instance can register hotkeys at a time.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Spotify download is slow the first time</strong></summary>

<br />

The first Spotify download also bootstraps spotDL and its Deno dependency. Subsequent Spotify downloads are much faster.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Find crash logs</strong></summary>

<br />

Beats writes crash logs to `%APPDATA%\Beats\` for unexpected errors. Include these when [opening an issue](https://github.com/Delexoo/beats/issues).
